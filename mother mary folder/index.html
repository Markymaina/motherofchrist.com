            <h2>About Mary</h2>
            <p>Mary, a young woman from Nazareth, was chosen by God to be the mother of Jesus Christ. Her life is a testament to faith and obedience. When the angel Gabriel appeared to her, announcing that she would conceive by the Holy Spirit, she responded with unwavering trust: “I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.” This moment marked the beginning of salvation history.</p>
